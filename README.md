# NLP_Yelp_Capstone_Phase_II
A non-traditional approach to solving Yelp websites relevance problem.

YELP is a web platform that runs on the web traffic generated by the valuable reviews 
from the consumers of the listed businesses. When the reviews are not relevant the Yelp
loses its credibility and the usage drops.

Addressing this as an overarching problem we worked a solution as a team for the capstone 
project .

Here my individual work and approach is uploaded for the sentiment prediction using
LDA outputs. Extracting probabilistic distribution features out of the LDA model topics on the reviews.
And using it to build a sophisticated predictive model.
